<h2>What is upload.py?</h2>
upload.py - script to automatically upload a webshell. i like automation eh. look at the code, you will understand from the comments what to do. if you feel like uploading another file, just type "upload it [path ot the file]" and this will upload that other file.

<h2>What is gifwebshell.php?</h2>
<br>
gifwebshell.php - GIF webshell type 1, where the server only checks whether or not the magic GIF [GIF89a] bytes are present in the file. here i took a random gif, added php code inside it and added __halt_compiler() to make things simpler in the end. This repo is to just make my life easier kek.
